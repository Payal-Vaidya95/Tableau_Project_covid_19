# 🌍 Global COVID-19 Testing & Vaccination Analysis Using Tableau

This project presents a comprehensive Tableau dashboard and visual story analyzing global COVID-19 testing, positivity rates, and vaccination coverage across May, June, and July of 2020 and 2023. Using three curated datasets, the project explores pandemic trends, public health responses, and the impact of immunization efforts worldwide.

## 📌 Objectives

- Visualize COVID-19 testing and positivity rates across countries and time periods  
- Compare pandemic dynamics between 2020 (pre-vaccine) and 2023 (post-vaccine rollout)  
- Map global vaccination coverage and identify regions with low immunization rates  
- Support public health awareness, policy planning, and resource allocation  

## 📊 Datasets Used

1. **COVID-19 Testing & Positivity (May–July 2020)**  
2. **COVID-19 Testing & Positivity (May–July 2023)**  
3. **Global Vaccination Data (up to January 18, 2023)**  

Each dataset includes variables such as country, date, tests conducted, positive cases, tested/million, positive/million, vaccination doses per 100 people, and % fully vaccinated.

## 📈 Visualizations Created

- **Line Graph**: COVID-19 positive cases per million (2020)  
- **Pie Chart**: Top 5 countries with highest positive cases (2020)  
- **Map Graph**: % of population fully vaccinated by country (2023)  
- **Bar Chart**: Vaccine doses per million by country  
- **Text Table**: Vaccination rates vs. positive cases (2023)  
- **Circle Graph**: Daily COVID-19 tests conducted (2023)  
- **Side-by-Side Chart**: Comparison of positivity rates (2020 vs. 2023)  

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Interactive filters by country, date, and vaccination status  
- Comparative views of testing and vaccination trends  
- Visual storytelling to highlight public health impact and global disparities  

## 💡 Key Insights

- Significant drop in positivity rates in 2023 compared to 2020, reflecting vaccine impact  
- Countries with higher vaccination rates showed lower infection rates  
- Visualization highlights gaps in global immunization and testing infrastructure
